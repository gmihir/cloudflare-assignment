# Mihir Gupta's Coding Challenge Submission

These are the project files for the general coding take-home assessment from Cloudflare. It is using a Cloudflare worker and HTMLRewriter in order to host an API that returns a array of JSON link objects as well as a static HTML page that uses those links.

To run this locally, simply run the following command in a terminal window:

`wrangler dev`


It was honestly quite refreshing and fun to learn some of the tools that Cloudflare provides. Thank you for your consideration!
